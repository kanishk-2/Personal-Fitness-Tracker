# Personal Fitness Tracker

## Overview
The Personal Fitness Tracker is a machine learning-based web application that helps users analyze fitness data and predict health metrics, such as calorie expenditure based on exercise details. It utilizes datasets like calories.csv and exercise.csv to train models using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor for accurate predictions. The project is built with Streamlit for an interactive interface and scikit-learn for machine learning, while Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly enhance data visualization. The Jupyter Notebook (fitness_tracker.ipynb) enables interactive data analysis, and fitness_tracker.py handles preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Designed to assist users in tracking and improving their fitness, this tool leverages machine learning for insightful health predictions.

## Features
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Uses `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly` to provide visual insights.
- 🏋️ **Fitness Data Analysis**: Reads `calories.csv` and `exercise.csv` for training machine learning models.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**: Implements `Linear Regression` and `Random Forest Regressor` for predictions.
- 🎯 **Model Optimization**: Uses `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.
- 📈 **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates models using `mean_squared_error` and other metrics.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/personal-fitness-tracker.git
   cd personal-fitness-tracker
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

## Project Structure

## How It Works
1. Load the Data: The app reads calories.csv and exercise.csv containing user activity records.
2. Train the Model: The script trains LinearRegression and RandomForestRegressor models to predict calorie expenditure.
3. Visualize Insights: The app displays interactive plots and metrics to help users understand their fitness trends.
4. Predict Calories Burned: Users can input their activity details, and the model will predict calories burned.
